1) The time and space complexity of converting a sorted list to a BST is O(nlogn) and O(n) respectively. The time complexity is a result on finding the middle node O(n/2) and recursively constructing a BST O(logn). The space complexity is just the same size as the number of elements in the list.

2) The time and space complexity is O(n). With regard to time, we only traverse the list once and the size is simply the number of elements in the lists.

3) The time complexity is O(n) because we only visit each node once to calculate the maximum path using a greedy algorithm. The space complexity is the number of nodes in the tree O(n).

4) The time complexity is O(n) because we traverse all the nodes in the tree. The space complexity is the number of nodes in the tree O(n).

5) The time complexity is O(nlogn) because we traverse the tree which has n nodes then make a new balanced tree. The space complexity is the number of nodes in the tree O(n).
